## Data-Driven Modernism

**Design Movement**: Contemporary data journalism meets clinical research aesthetics

**Core Principles**:
1. Information hierarchy through visual weight and color coding
2. Scannable data presentation with clear metrics and statistics
3. Credible, professional presentation befitting research analysis
4. Accessible complexity - making dense data approachable

**Color Philosophy**: 
- Foundation: Clinical whites (#FAFBFC) with deep navy anchors (#0F172A, #1E293B)
- Category-specific accent colors for each research domain (amber for aging, purple for consciousness, emerald for mitochondrial health, etc.)
- Emotional intent: Trust, precision, scientific rigor with warmth through golden accents

**Layout Paradigm**: 
- Asymmetric grid system with data cards
- Left-aligned content with breathing room
- Modular card-based architecture for research categories
- Sidebar navigation for filtering and search

**Signature Elements**:
1. Category color-coding system with gradient badges
2. Research document count badges with hover states
3. Network visualization background (interconnected nodes representing research connections)

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Smooth transitions revealing metadata on hover
- Data reveal animations (fade-in with slight upward motion)
- Click interactions expand categories to show full document lists
- Search filters with real-time results

**Animation**:
- Subtle fade-in on scroll for cards (0.3s ease-out)
- Hover state: gentle lift (translateY(-4px)) with shadow increase
- Category selection: border pulse effect
- Statistics counter animation on page load

**Typography System**:
- Display: IBM Plex Sans (600/700) for headings and data labels - technical precision
- Body: IBM Plex Sans (400/500) for descriptions and metadata
- Editorial: Crimson Pro (600) for section headers - adds gravitas
- Monospace: IBM Plex Mono for document IDs and technical references

## Brutalist Information Architecture

**Design Movement**: Neo-brutalism with stark data presentation

**Core Principles**:
1. Raw, unadorned information display
2. Extreme contrast and bold typography
3. Functional minimalism - every element serves data
4. Honest, unpolished aesthetic

**Color Philosophy**:
- Stark black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) foundation
- Single accent: electric cyan (#00FFFF) for interactive elements
- Emotional intent: Unfiltered truth, raw data, no embellishment

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Terminal-inspired grid with monospace everywhere
- Dense information blocks with hard edges
- No rounded corners, no gradients
- Table-based layouts for maximum data density

**Signature Elements**:
1. ASCII-art dividers between sections
2. Terminal-style document listings
3. Raw JSON-style data cards

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Instant state changes, no transitions
- Click reveals full data dumps
- Keyboard-first navigation

**Animation**:
- None. Instant state changes only.

**Typography System**:
- Everything: JetBrains Mono at various weights
- Headings: 700 weight, all caps
- Body: 400 weight
- Data: 500 weight

## Organic Data Garden

**Design Movement**: Biomorphic design with natural growth patterns

**Core Principles**:
1. Data as living organisms - growth and connection
2. Soft, flowing shapes inspired by cellular structures
3. Warm, inviting approach to complex information
4. Nature-inspired visual metaphors

**Color Philosophy**:
- Soft sage greens (#8FA998, #A8C5B4) as foundation
- Warm terracotta (#D4876E) and golden honey (#E8B563) accents
- Deep forest green (#2D5A3D) for anchors
- Emotional intent: Growth, vitality, natural wisdom, organic discovery

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Flowing, organic grid that breaks traditional constraints
- Circular and curved containers instead of rectangles
- Radial layouts for category exploration
- Vine-like connection lines between related research

**Signature Elements**:
1. Cellular blob shapes for category cards
2. Branch-and-node visualization for research connections
3. Organic dividers with leaf motifs

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Gentle, elastic animations
- Hover states that "bloom" and expand
- Organic transitions that feel like natural growth
- Categories connect visually when related

**Animation**:
- Elastic easing (spring physics) for all interactions
- Cards "grow" in on scroll (scale from 0.8 to 1)
- Hover: gentle pulsing glow effect
- Category connections animate like growing vines

**Typography System**:
- Display: Fraunces (soft serif with organic curves) for headings
- Body: Inter with generous line height for readability
- Accent: Recoleta for editorial emphasis
- All text has soft shadows for depth
